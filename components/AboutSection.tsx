              My fascination with the scientific side of programming drives me
              to explore math, physics, and build simulations for real-world
              scenarios, enhancing my problem-solving abilities.

              Besides application and web development, I&apos;m also passionate about
              machine learning. My solid foundation in this field allows me to
              integrate AI-driven features into my projects and explore
              innovative solutions.
